# 🔍 **Atlas Search in Monggregate**

MongoDB's aggregation framework provides powerful search capabilities through the `$search` and `$searchMeta` stages, available exclusively with MongoDB Atlas. Monggregate makes these advanced search features accessible through an intuitive Python interface.

## 📋 **What is Atlas Search?**

> 💡 Atlas Search integrates full-text search capabilities directly into your MongoDB database, providing functionality similar to dedicated search engines like Elasticsearch or Algolia.

Atlas Search offers:

- 🔤 **Full-text search** with language-aware text analysis
- 🔄 **Fuzzy matching** to handle typos and misspellings
- ✏️ **Autocomplete** suggestions for partial queries
- ⭐ **Relevance scoring** to rank results by importance
- 🔆 **Highlighting** to emphasize matching terms
- 📊 **Faceting** for categorizing and filtering results
- 🌍 **Geospatial search** for location-based queries
- 🧠 **Vector search** for semantic similarity and AI applications

> 📚 For a complete feature list, see the [Atlas Search documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/atlas-search-overview/).

## 🔰 **Basic Search Queries**

Creating a basic search query with Monggregate is straightforward:

```python
from monggregate import Pipeline

pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.search(
    path="description",  # Field to search in
    query="apple"        # Search term
)
```

> 📘 By default, Monggregate uses the `text` operator for search queries. This query will find all documents containing "apple" in the description field.

### ✨ **Adding Fuzzy Matching**

To handle typos and minor spelling variations, add fuzzy matching:

```python
from monggregate import Pipeline
from monggregate.search.commons import FuzzyOptions

pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.search(
    path="description",
    query="apple",
    fuzzy=FuzzyOptions(
        max_edits=2  # Allow up to 2 character edits
    )
)
```

> 🔍 This query will match terms like "appl", "appel", or "aple" in addition to "apple".

## 🛠️ **Advanced Search with Operators**

Atlas Search provides several specialized operators for different search needs:

### 📝 **Text Search**

```python
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.search(
    operator_name="text",  # Explicitly specify text operator
    path="plot",
    query="space adventure",
    fuzzy=FuzzyOptions(max_edits=1)
)
```

### ✏️ **Autocomplete**

```python
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.search(
    operator_name="autocomplete",
    path="title",
    query="star w",      # Will match "Star Wars"
    fuzzy=FuzzyOptions(max_edits=1)
)
```

### 🔣 **Regex Search**

```python
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.search(
    operator_name="regex",
    path="email",
    query="^john\\.[a-z]+@example\\.com$"  # Match specific email pattern
)
```

## 🧩 **Compound Search Queries**

> 💡 The real power of Atlas Search emerges with compound queries that combine multiple search conditions.

The `compound` operator supports four types of clauses:

- 🔒 **must**: Documents MUST match these conditions AND they affect relevance score
- 🔍 **filter**: Documents MUST match these conditions but they DON'T affect relevance score
- ⭐ **should**: Documents SHOULD match these conditions and they affect relevance score
- 🚫 **mustNot**: Documents MUST NOT match these conditions

### 🏗️ **Building Compound Queries**

Monggregate provides a unique "search pipeline" approach for building compound queries:

```python
pipeline = Pipeline()
# Initialize a compound search
pipeline.search(
    index="movies",           # Search index name
    operator_name="compound"
).search(                     # Add a "must" clause
    clause_type="must", 
    query="adventure",
    path="genres"
).search(                     # Add a "should" clause
    clause_type="should",
    query="space",
    path="plot"
).search(                     # Add a "mustNot" clause
    clause_type="mustNot",
    query="horror",
    path="genres"
)
```

This query will:
1. 🔒 REQUIRE documents to have "adventure" in the genres field
2. ⭐ PREFER documents with "space" in the plot (boosting relevance score)
3. 🚫 EXCLUDE documents with "horror" in the genres field

The resulting MongoDB aggregation will look like:

```json
[
    {
        "$search": {
            "index": "movies",
            "compound": {
                "must": {
                    "text": {
                        "query": "adventure",
                        "path": "genres"
                    }
                },
                "should": {
                    "text": {
                        "query": "space",
                        "path": "plot"
                    }
                },
                "mustNot": {
                    "text": {
                        "query": "horror",
                        "path": "genres"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## 📊 **Faceted Search with searchMeta**

> 📘 Faceted search allows users to filter and navigate search results by categories or attributes.

Use the `search_meta` stage to implement faceting:

```python
pipeline = Pipeline()
# Initialize a faceted search
pipeline.search_meta(
    index="movies",
    collector_name="facet"
).search_meta(               # Add string facet on genres
    facet_type="string",
    path="genres",
    num_buckets=10           # Return top 10 genres
).search_meta(               # Add numeric facet on year
    facet_type="number",
    path="year",
    boundaries=[1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020]
)
```

This creates a faceted search that:
1. 📋 Groups movies by genre, showing the top 10 most common genres
2. 📅 Splits movies into date ranges (pre-1970, 1970s, 1980s, etc.)

### 🔗 **Combining Search and Facets**

You can combine regular search with faceting to create powerful filtered search experiences:

```python
pipeline = Pipeline()
# First define search criteria
pipeline.search_meta(
    index="movies",
    operator_name="text",
    path="plot",
    query="space"
# Then add faceting
).search_meta(
    collector_name="facet"
).search_meta(
    facet_type="string",
    path="genres"
)
```

> 🔍 This will search for "space" in movie plots, then return facet counts showing which genres are most common in the results.

## 🌟 **Complete Search Example**

Here's a comprehensive example that combines multiple search features:

```python
# Create search pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.search(
    index="default",
    operator_name="compound"
).search(
    # Movies must be from the 2000s
    clause_type="filter",
    operator_name="range",
    path="year",
    gte=2000,
    lte=2009
).search(
    # Movies should contain "future" in plot
    clause_type="should",
    operator_name="text",
    path="plot",
    query="future",
    score={"boost": {"value": 3}}  # Boost relevance
).search(
    # Movies should contain "technology" in plot
    clause_type="should",
    operator_name="text",
    path="plot",
    query="technology"
).limit(10).project(
    title=1,
    year=1,
    plot=1,
    score={"$meta": "searchScore"}  # Include relevance score
)

# Execute the pipeline
results = list(db.movies.aggregate(pipeline.export()))
for movie in results:
    print(f"{movie['title']} ({movie['year']}) - Score: {movie['score']:.2f}")
```

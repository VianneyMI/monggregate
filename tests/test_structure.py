"""Tests for the structure of the project.

Perfect! Our test is now working correctly and providing a detailed report of all missing test files. The test fails as expected, showing that 83 out of 99 modules (16.2% coverage) are currently missing test files.
The output clearly shows each missing test file with its expected location, which makes it easy to identify which files need tests.
Here's what the test does:
Scans all Python files in src/monggregate recursively
For each source file, calculates the expected test file path by:
Maintaining the same directory structure under tests/tests_monggregate
Adding a test_ prefix to the filename
Checks if the expected test file exists
Reports detailed statistics on missing tests:
Total count of missing test files
Coverage percentage
List of all missing files with their expected test file locations
The test is working correctly according to your requirements:
It verifies that for every file under src/monggregate, there is a corresponding file under tests/tests_monggregate
It confirms that the path structure matches (except for the root directory change)
It ensures file naming follows the convention where test files are prefixed with test_
When failing, it clearly shows which test files are missing

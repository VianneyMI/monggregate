Definition
-----------

Adds new fields to documents. $set outputs documents that contain all existing fields from the inputs documents
and newly added fields.

The $set stage is an alias for $addFields.

Both stages are equivalent to a $project stage that explicitly specifies all existing fields in the inputs documents and adds the new fields.

$set has the following form:

    >>> { $set: { <newField>: <expression>, ... } }

Specify the name of each field to add and set its value to an aggregation expression. For more information on expressions, see Expressions.

$set appends new fields to existing documents. You can include one or more $set stages in an aggregation operation.

To add field or fields to embedded documents (including documents in arrays) use the dot notation.
See example : https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/set/#std-label-set-add-field-to-embedded

To add an element to an existing array field with $set, use with $concatArrays.
See example : https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/set/#std-label-set-add-element-to-array

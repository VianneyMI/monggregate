# Definition
---------------------------------

The $group stage separates documents into groups according to a "group key". The output is one document for each unique group key.

A group key is often a field, or group of fields. The group key can also be the result of an expression. Use the _id field in the $group pipeline stage to set the group key. See below for
usage examples.

In the $group stage output, the _id field is set to the group key for that document.

The output documents can also contain additional fields that are set using
accumulator expressions.

NOTE : The group stage does not order its output documents.

The $group stage has the following prototype form:

    >>> {
            $group:{
                    _id: <expression>, // Group key
                    <field1>: { <accumulator1> : <expression1> },
                    ...
            }
        }

The _id and the accumulator operators can accept any valid expression. For more information on expressions, see Expressions.

Considerations
------------------------------
The $group stage has a limit of 100 megabytes of RAM. By default, if the stage exceeds this limit,
$group returns an error. To allow more space for stage processing, use the allowDiskUse option to enable aggregation pipeline stages to write data to temporary files.

Performance Optimizations
------------------------------

This section describes optimizations to improve the performance of
$group. There are optimizations that you can make manually and optimizations MongoDB makes internally.

Optimization to Return the First Document of Each Group

If a pipeline sorts and groups by the same field and the
$group stage only uses the $first accumulator operator, consider adding an index on the grouped field which matches the sort order. In some cases, the
$group stage can use the index to quickly find the first document of each group.

Slot-Based Query Execution Engine
Starting in version 5.2, MongoDB uses the slot-based execution query engine to execute
$group stages if either:

    * $group is the first stage in the pipeline.

    * All preceding stages in the pipeline can also be executed by the slot-based engine.

For more information, see $group Optimization.

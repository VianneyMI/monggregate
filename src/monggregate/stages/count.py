Last Updated (in this package) : 18/09/2022
Source : https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/count/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-count

Definition
-------------------

Passes a document to the next stage that contains a count of the number of documents input to the stage.

$count has the following prototype form:
   >>> {"$count":"string"}

<string> is the name of the output field which has the count as its value.
<string> must be a non-empty string, must not start with $ and must not contain the . character.


Behavior
-------------------
The $count stage is equivalent to the following
$group + $project sequence:

   >>>  db.collection.aggregate([
            { $group: { _id: null, myCount: { $sum: 1 } } },
            { $project: { _id: 0 } }
        ])

where myCount would be the output field that contains the count. You can specify another name for the output field.

autocomplete        Performs a search-as-you-type query from an incomplete input string.
compound            Combines other operators into a single query.
embeddedDocument    Queries fields in embedded documents, which are documents that are elements of an array.
equals              Works in conjunction with the boolean and objectId data types.
exists              Tests for the presence of a specified field.
geoShape            Queries for values with specified geo shapes.
geoWithin           Queries for points within specified geographic shapes.
moreLikeThis        Queries for similar documents.
near                Queries for values near a specified number, date, or geo point.
phrase              Searches documents for terms in an order similar to the query.
queryString         Supports querying a combination of indexed fields and values.
range               Queries for values within a specific numeric or date range.
regex               Interprets the query field as a regular expression.
